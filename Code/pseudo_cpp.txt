This is the C++ code uploaded to the arduino board
which gets the temperature and humidity values from the sensor.
This data is printed on the serial monitor for the python IDE to read.

Start {
	begin serial communication
}

loop {
	while (data is available) {
		read the data from sensor
	}

	print temperature
	print humidity

	delay code for 2 seconds
}
