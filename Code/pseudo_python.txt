This is the python code for getting data from arduino IDE
and using an SVM model on the dataset.

create "arduino" object to access serial port
delay code for 2 seconds
read dataset's csv file
create array from csv file
extract weather conditions from dataset
create table for humidity and temperature

create classifier with SVC
train the data with the classifier

loop forever{
	get temperature from arduino IDE
	get humidity from arduino IDE

	print temperature
	print humidity

	create array with temperature and humidity values
	test the SVC model on this data
	print the prediction
}
